[Welcome to Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)

This is a static-site generator that transforms Markdown from obsidian content into websites. It is an alternative to the Obsidian office website service.

- Fundamental features: Great.
    - Code block, Link, Image
- Special features: I love it !
    - Links notes like Obsidian
    - Preview a linked notes like Obsidian
- Math block is bad!

This is a good way to make a blog website. But I would like to a batter math block.
